Writing samples, over the past few years
</p>

My name is Neal, and Iâ€™m an airplane pilot, English Literature grad, and former IT specialist who lives in the Dallas, Texas area.  

This used to be a blog about my CNC hobby back in 2015 or so. It's now just used for a sample of my writings over the years such as blog posts, proposals, marketing emails, and social media content.

Thanks for reading!
