My name is Neal, and Iâ€™m an airplane pilot, English Literature grad, and former IT specialist who lives in the Dallas, Texas area.  

This used to be a blog about my CNC hobby back in 2015 or so. It's now just used for a sample of my writings over the years such as blog posts, proposals, marketing emails, and social media content.

You can navigate with the "Posts by.." links in the menu.

Thanks for reading!
