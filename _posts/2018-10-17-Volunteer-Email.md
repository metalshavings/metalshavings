<p>Good evening Robert,</p>
<p>Five cities, 14 airplanes, 20 flights, and 11,585 pounds were moved today.  </p>
<p>Supply is still building, and we are going to cease flights at the end of the day tomorrow, so anyone who wants to fly should head to Gainesville tomorrow in the AM.  A good turnout tomorrow from Florida and south Georgia local pilots should be enough to empty the hangar.  We'll still be going to MAI, 17J, A51, and F95 tomorrow.</p>
<p>We know that we have three more CFIs coming with airplanes from The College of Missionary Aviation in Keystone Heights, FL.  They sent three airplanes over the weekend as well.  We also have an Aerostar coming from Ocala that will help move some slightly bigger loads for a couple of runs.  But we have plenty of supply thanks to a large medical donation sourced by the University of Florida. So if you're nearby and on the fence, come fly with us tomorrow and help us hand University Air the keys to a hangar as empty as we found it a week ago.</p>
<p>For those of you in North Carolina still seeing these emails, we have somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000 pounds of excess donated supply in Raleigh that the donors wish to see in Florida, if we can get it there.  So if anyone wants to come down from North Carolina we can get you a load to fly with from RDU.  Give us a call or text at (940) 320-9407 if that's you, and we'll get you the phone numbers to contact in Raleigh and a destination in Florida to fly to.  </p>
<p>We have been able to source a truck for the Miami Fire/Police donations that we mentioned in yesterday's email, and local airline pilots in Miami organized by Vincent Caldara have offered to throw in a few airplane rides as well to handle their medical/fragile cargo for them.  They plan to move that supply over the weekend and into Monday or Tuesday of next week.</p>
<p>We will announce the end of our Florida operation to the public tomorrow and will have a local charity advertised on Facebook/Twitter for those who have remaining supply donations.</p>
<p>Thanks again to you all for another successful deployment!</p>
<p>- The Operation Airdrop Board of Directors</p>
<p><strong>For those who are seeing our emails for the first time:</strong></p>
<p>If you plan to fly with us in Florida, please familiarize yourself with use of the Compassion callsign. The document prepared by AOPA <a href="https://www.operation-airdrop.com/compassion.pdf">here</a> explains its use including a sample flight plan form for those who file IFR. Note that it may also be used with VFR flight following, it is not only for IFR use.</p>
<p>Using this has multiple benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>it tells ATC who you are and what you're doing, and places you higher in priority</li>
<li>it allows us to better account for everyone via flight tracking services like FlightAware</li>
<li>it allows ATC to better plan for the increases in ops per day to ensure that we don't "overload the system"</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, we do require a liability waiver to be accepted and signed to fly with us. It should be familiar to those of you who have flown with other charity organizations. In summary it states that:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are current and legal to fly your aircraft</li>
<li>your aircraft is current and legal to be flown</li>
<li>you are the pilot in command of your aircraft and all flight decisions are your own</li>
<li>you are flying as a volunteer, and cannot accept payment for flying as a volunteer</li>
<li>you have liability insurance on your aircraft</li>
<li>you have not had your pilot certificate suspended or revoked</li>
</ul>
<p>The form may be downloaded <a href="https://www.operation-airdrop.com/volunteer-waiver.pdf">here</a> and returned to us by scan/email to contact@operation-airdrop.com, by text message to (940) 320-9407, or by paper copy in person to an OAD staff member when you arrive at a staging airport.</p>
