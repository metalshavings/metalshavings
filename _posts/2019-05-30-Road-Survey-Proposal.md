The linked PDF is a draft of a proposal for a potential business or funded non-profit involved in surveying roads after hurricanes for flood and obstruction damage, which unfortunately was rendered obsolete by rapid adancement in civilian RADAR satellite technology in the past year.

I prepared the entire document, including cost analysis and GIS data/calculations.
