title: Road Survey Study and Proposal

The linked PDF is a draft of a proposal for a potential business or funded non-profit involved in surveying roads after hurricanes for flood and obstruction damage, which unfortunately was rendered obsolete by the recent launch of civilian radar satellite contractors.

In short, a radar satellite can see through clouds, so there's no reason to scout roads with aircraft after natural disasters anymore.

I prepared the entire document, including cost analysis and GIS data/calculations.
