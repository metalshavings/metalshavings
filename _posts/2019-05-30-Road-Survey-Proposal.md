The linked PDF was prepared as a proposal for a potential business in surveying roads after hurricanes for flood and obstruction damage, which unfortunately was rendered obsolete by the recent launch of civilian radar satellite contractors.

In short, a radar satellite can see through clouds, so there's no reason to scout roads with aircraft after natural disasters anymore.

I prepared the entire document, including cost analysis and GIS data/calculations.
