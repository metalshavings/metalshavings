The linked Facebook post was created from volunteer images submitted over the week of relief efforts that we organized following hurricane Florence in North Carolina in 2018.

This one was prepared in similar fashion after hurricane Michael relief efforts a few weeks later in Florida.

These videos of crowd-sourced content have become the 'signature' of this organization for lack of a better word. They are a good way to get everyone who participates some screen time, for lack of a better word, and promote highly sharable content that tends to spread the organization's brand.
